# Ticket Machine project

This is ticket machine project code written by Tadesse Sentayehu.

My ID is 342650983.

This project is for a drugstore customer service purpose. Here the customer will choose different sites of the drugstore that he want to visit.

This device asks you what activity you've come to complete and gives you a turn number based on the activity you chose.

In this example, you are going to design it for a drugstore that focuses on perfumery, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. Your program will ask the consumer which of the places they wish to visit, and depending on the area they choose, it will assign them a relevant turn number.

I used python 3 and pycharm to write the code. This project has three main parts named: ticket_machine_apps, ticket_machine_main and ticket_machine_utiles. On ticket_machine_apps file there is the main code of the project, on ticket_machine_main file, there is call for every function and on ticket_machine_utiles, there is help function called random inorder to help the customer to play luck game and get discount.

At the end of the program, Customers will take different numbers for different areas (perfumes, medicine, cosmetics) in different orders, so the system must keep track of how many numbers it has given for each of those areas and produce the next number for each as they request it.
